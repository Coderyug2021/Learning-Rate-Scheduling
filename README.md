# Learning Rate Scheduling 

This file contains everything you need to know about Learning Rate Scheduling, it will clear questions like Why, When and How?

It contains both implementation and information about every Learning Rate Scheduling techniques.

The techniques included are :

1. Power Scheduling

2. Exponential Scheduling 

3. Piecewise Scheduling 

4. One Cycle scheduling 

 and in the last my personal views on which learning rate scheduling you should use and which proved to be the best in the past few years.
 Finally, a tensorboard visualization for the models created with different Learning Rate Scheduling Techniques.
